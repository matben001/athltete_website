                  Good morning, everyone! I'm Mathieu! I was very active when I was young. I was involved in all sports: competitive alpine skiing, running,cross-crountry skiing, mountain biking and, finally, triathlon. I started triathlon at an elite level at the age of 18. Since that day, I have never stopped doing triathlon and my passion has never stopped growing. 
This triathlon journey has taken me to many place around the world and I can't wait to discover more
